# generate your own id_rsa key for logging into the containers
ssh-keygen -t rsa 
# hit enter to accept all the defaults

# build the container with ssh
docker build . -t ssh_container

# startup as many containers as you want:
docker run -td --name YOUR-CONTAINER-NAME -v /root/.ssh:/root/.ssh ssh_container
# NOTE: change the name for each one you want to startup.

# get the IP address of the container
docker inspect YOUR-CONTAINER-NAME | grep -i IPAddress | cut -d '"' -f 4 | tail -1
# NOTE change the name to your container name above

# use this command to ssh into the container:
ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no YOUR-CONTAINER-IP

# spin up as many as you need and then run ansible from the server to the containers
# Good luck!
